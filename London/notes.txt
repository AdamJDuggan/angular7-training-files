src/html
is the file which will run. It contains an instance of the
very top level which in this case is called weather.

src/main.ts
defines the name of the top level Angular module file which in
our case is called AppModule.

A class is a blueprint for creating objects with specific
functions and properties already attached to it.

Components let us create a new HTML language and they are how we structure Angular applications.
HTML comes with a bunch of pre-built tags like <input> and <form> which look and behave a certain
way. In Angular we create new custom tags with their own look and behaviour. An Angular application is therefore just a set of custom tags that interact with each other, we call
these tags Components.
